AddConstraintColumnCommand.usage=add-column <column-path>
AddConstraintColumnCommand.help = \t{0} - adds a column reference to the table constraint (i.e., primary key, unique constraint, access pattern, foreign key, or index). \n\n \
\tNote 1: Use the "find Column" command to find the paths of columns in your workspace.\n \
\tNote 2: You can also use tab completion to get a list of the column paths.
AddConstraintColumnCommand.examples= \

AddConstraintColumnCommand.COLUMN_REF_ADDED = The column at "{0}" has been added to table constraint "{1}".
AddConstraintColumnCommand.COLUMN_PATH_NOT_FOUND = The specified column path of "{0}" cannot be found in the workspace. Use the "find Column" command to find column paths.

AddConstraintColumnCommand.INVALID_COLUMN_PATH = The path at "{0}" is not a path to a column.
AddConstraintColumnCommand.INVALID_COLUMN = The column "{0}" must have the same parent table as table constraint "{1}".
AddConstraintColumnCommand.MISSING_COLUMN_PATH = Please specify the workspace path of the column you wish to reference in this constraint.
